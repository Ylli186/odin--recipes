<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1/3 cup ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    <li>6 (2 ounce) pieces fresh mozzarella</li>

    <li>Turn crust ninety degrees do not flip dough over. Grill until crust shows light grill marks, 1 to 3 minutes. </li>
